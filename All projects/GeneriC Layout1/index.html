    <h2>Pink Clouds</h2>
     <p>
       The color of clouds depends on the angle of the sun’s light, in relation to the Earth’s atmosphere.
        <br><br>
       Though it is deemed as ‘white light’, the sun releases light in all colors. Once the sun rays reach the Earth’s atmosphere, 
       all color wavelengths in the sunlight scatter in all directions. The shorter wavelengths – blue and violet – scatter first. 
       That said, blue won’t scatter away as quickly as violet, so blue is dominant enough that people can see it. It’s also why our 
       sky looks blue most of the time than any other color.
       <br><br>
        When the sun is at its peak, the sunlight travels through less amount of atmosphere and has a high angle. That means blue 
       will dominate. During sunset, the sun angle is low and the light has to travel through more amount of atmosphere. This leads 
       to the complete scattering of the blue, violet, and yellow wavelengths, leaving only red and orange wavelengths to be seen. 
       Red color has the longest wavelength, and the last to scatter.
        <br><br>
       Pink is a shade of red and can typically appear around sunrise and sunset.
        <br><br>
       Speaking of the pink clouds, the clouds do not become pink; in fact, clouds lack an intrinsic color, they are just reflecting 
       pink/red waves effectively.
        <br><br>
       Environmental factors such as dust, pollution, haze, and cloud formations may also contribute to different shades of light as 
       the sun rises or sets.

    <h2>Pink Skies?</h2>
    
    <p>
      The sky is pink during sunset and sunrise for the same reason that the sky is blue.
      <br><br>
      Light is white, but when passed through a prism, it gives different colored light waves in the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, 
      green, blue, indigo, and violet (VIBGYOR). Light travels in waves, sometimes as short ones and other times as long lines. Light 
      will continue to travel in a straight line unless there’s interference from atmospheric molecules or a prism.
      <br><br>
      Atmospheric gases, clouds, and other particles scatter light, and since blue light travels on shorter waves, it causes charged 
      particles to move faster, scattering more light. Thus, we see more blue in the sky. Human eyes are also a bit more sensitive to 
      blue rays, which indeed helps.
      <br><br>
      As a general rule, the longer the light travels through the sky, the more color it loses. Some colors like red and orange do make 
      it through, however. During sunrise, light has to travel a longer distance before it reaches our eyes. Pink being a shade of red, 
      also reaches us. Thus, the morning sky appears with a blaze of pink or red.
