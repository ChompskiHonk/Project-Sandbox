      <div id="desc">
       <p><span>水車</span>, or <span>Shisha</span>, is the japanese word for <span>''Water Wheel''</span>.The name come from the desire to create shows and movies that display smooth 2D animations as fluidly and naturally as water moves. 
      <br><br>
      They idea behind naming the company after a water wheel come from how looping animations usually operate; as a forward motion of frames that are shown one after the other, always repeating the cycle, the same way water wheels were built to continuously spin vy cathing falling or flowing water to create energy.
