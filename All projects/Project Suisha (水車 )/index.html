       <h2>What is Suisha?</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="a-few-words">
      <div id="desc">
       <p>Shisha is the japanese word for "Water Wheel", and that name come from the desire to create shows and movies that display smooth 2D animations as fluidly and naturally as water moves. 
      <br><br>
      They idea behind naming the company after a water wheel come from how looping animations usually operate; as a forward motion of frames that are shown one after the other, always repeating the cycle, the same way water wheels were built to continuously spin vy cathing falling or flowing water to create energy.

    <div id="goals">
      <p>
        Our goal is to tell great stories and supply them with beautiful art, animation and music. We want to entertain others not unlike how anime as a whole has provided comfort, relative experiences and joy in general.
